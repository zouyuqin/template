		<h1>Formal Research Report</h1>
		<p>Different people have different interests and different ambitions. Those differences lead to different choices of major in college. But not all of the people understand what are their majors all about and ignore the importance of writing, reading and researching about their majors. The major we are going to understand today is accounting. </p>
		<p>Nowadays, the number of business students especially accounting students is exploding. But not all of the new accounting students know what is accounting and why we need accounting. Accounting is not only account things but also research, collect, classify and analysis finance-related records. Not like the general idea, accounting is actually called “the language of business”. Accounting is made up of two parts, one is accounting theory which including accouting system and accounting standard, at the same time another part is accounting methods. Even though accounting seems like a modern scientific discipline, it actually has a long history ---accounting even existed in 12s century. So what cause accounting to be so important for the society? The ultimate goal of processing accounting is to improve economic returns. Obviously, economic world is one of the most important parts of the whole society, and the economic growth is the ultimate goal for the whole economic world, as a result accounting is one of the most important part of the society.  </p>
		<p>Even a freshman in college knows how hard it is going to be to study accounting. In Michigan State University, there is a ‘tale’ about accounting. It said that almost 30% of the Chinese girls major in accounting, and approximately 50% of them changed their major in the end. From those numbers we can see it is really hard to become an accountant. But how can we become an accountant? Only studying in fiscal textbook cannot help people become a good accountant. Actually, there are three parts that plays extremely important parts of accounting. They are researching, communicating and technology. It is really important for both accounting students and accountants to work out with those three parts. </p>
		<p>The graph below shows the 3 important parts in accounting. </p>
		 <pp><img src="6993746C-B6B1-4458-A8BA-7CCBBE7D2592.png" width="1000" height="600" alt="Fig. 1 Ecological zone of Nepal (modified after Lillesø and others 2005)" longdesc="267_2012_3_Fig1_HTML.gif" /></h4>
        <p>Firstly, researching is a really important part of learning and even doing accounting works. As Teresa P. Gordon and Jason C. Porter have said that: “Academic research looks at how accounting affects the world around us and how the world affects accounting.” Researching in accounting is like biological specimen for biology. As we all know, biologics need biological specimen to study different functions in different cells and lead to a general idea about all the species. Likewise, accountant need to research to study how the economy operates today in the US or in other country, and all of those researches are beneficial for accountant adjusting their financial decisions.  </p>
		<p>Actually, researching benefits both accountants and accounting students. The reason why accountants need to do research is because economic world changes everyday, every hour and even every second. Lack of researching may lead to a tragedy. For example, according to the “Plaza Accord” which signed by America, Japan, German, France and England the interest rate between America and Japan decrease 50% in three years. Lack of doing research may cause a company bankruptcy. Not only government record may change the economy, but also climate, war declaring, scandal, and even illness. Due to those variant reasons, accountants need to do researches every day in order to understand the condition outside in order to make the best decision for the employer. At the same time, the reason why the accounting students need to do the researching is because the accounting standards alter very often. From the interview to Li Xu, an accountant in China, she said that: “ The standard in accounting often change. For instance, during the past few years the standard of financial statements changed a lot. If I use the oldest standard of financial statement, some accountants cannot even understand what is it talking about. It is really important for accounting student to learn how to use the newest standard. Otherwise, your financial statements become a wasting paper.” </p>
		<p>Furthermore, reading is an efficient way to improve researching. On the one hand, reading helps accountants and accounting students understand the researching. Like microscope for biological research, ability to read is one of the most efficient tools to help accountant research. The ability to read includes the ability to understand the condition, influence, importance and the content of the research. Accountants need have the ability to read both superficial meaning and deep-seated meaning of the research. Because accountants need to analyze the research they got and make the right estimates and predictions. On the other hand, reading helps accountants and accounting students know the basic theory published in the past. Even though accounting involves in the present decision and future forecast the classic theory is also important for accountant and accounting students. From the interview to Dr. Martin, a economy professor in Michigan State University, he told us: “ I think it is really important for accountants and accounting people read economics magnum opus. I always introduce some good economic books for students. Because from reading we can understand how the whole theory work. Even though we learnt the tidy theory in class, the whole process is elaborately shown in the book. The theory we learnt in class is like an ending in ‘Hamlet’, we really need to understand what is the context of that ending and whole process of the ‘story’ in order to get a better understanding about the theory.” In conclusion, researching is an important part for accountant and accounting students, and one way to improve researching is reading. </p>
		<p>Secondly, communication also takes an important role of accounting life. Basically, what accountants do are managing and expressing the financial related records to the interested customers. The communications in accounting are rational and different to the communication in other discipline. The communications we did are much easier than in accounting. Imagine you are an American, and you need to tell a story to a Chinese people who only know a little English. It is really hard, isn’t it? The communications between accountants and customers are really difficult. Normally, the customers accountants need to deal with are people without business knowledge. For example when an accountant use some professional words like ‘physical inventory system’ to his or her customers, the customers will surely get mad and even end the cooperation with the accountant. Sometimes it is much more easier to introduce a difficult words than a simple words. So how to efficiently communicate is one of the basic tasks for accountant and accounting students.  </p>
		<p>Actually, there are two ways for accountants to communicate, one of them is talking and another is writing. The reason why talking is important for accountants is because talking is the most basic way to explain their job and make the customers or employers understand that the accountants deserve the salary. But not all of the accountants understand the importance of the talking skill. A great example to illustrate this opinion is the article ‘Accounting Scene: What’s It All About?’ from a famous trade journal called ‘Business And Economics---Accounting’. The author firstly gave us a general sense of accounting. And then the author mentioned a topic that most accountants always ignore, that is accountants rarely “explain any of the basic concepts to their clients”. Accounting scene: What's it all about? (1991). The National Public Accountant, 36(7),6.Retrievedfromhttp://ezproxy.msu.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/232299767?accountid=12598 Actually most of the accountants put all of their time to improve their professional skill but ignore the talking skill. Like the humor story author told, most complains from the clients are because of the pool talking skills accountants have. Good talking skills give accountants good relationships with the clients in order to make accountants’ work easier. Because of accountants good talking skills the clients may have more confidence on this accountants. Sometimes accountants are used to say financial words to accurate the description, but this may make misunderstanding from the clients. What is more, the clients may start to dislike you and end the cooperation. On the other hand, why writing is important for accountant is because accountants need to use writing to summarize condition of the companies or individuals. Li Xu, an accountant in China, said that: “I need to write a financial report once a month. A report is one of the most efficient way to let the ‘big boss’ understand what is the financial situation in company. Because not all of the employers are business major, sometimes writing skill is really important. You will need to make the summary both professional and understandable for all kinds of people. It is really hard for accountants. Because sometimes when you learnt something deeper, it is hard for you to make it easier to understand. I always joke to my friends that I am actually a writer not an accountant.” From the interview from Li Xu we can understand how important writing is for accountant. In fact, writing is like a process of information output, the accountants who have better skills of information out put can win recognition from the employers or customers, but accountants who have poor skills of writing may cause the employers or customers feel disappointment. </p>
		<p>So how to improve communication skills? The answer is really easy: try to ‘stand in other’s shoes’. Accountants should imagine that they are not accountant s but costumers, and ask themselves “Will I understand this if I know nothing about accounting?” Because the people accountants need to deal with may have different major in college, it is important for accountants to stand on customers’ shoes and explain for them. Accountants need to try their best to make the communication concise and easy to understand.  </p>
		<p>In a word communication—includes talking and writing—is really important for accountants. And one way to improve communication skill is to ‘stand in customers’ shoes’. </p>
		<p>At last, Technology plays an important part of accounting as well. Even though cell phones, internets have some influence among accounting, the most important technology for accountants is computer. In fact, technology influence the way accountants work. In the past, accountant use pen to write down the financial statement and use calculator to count different items. But at the present, accountants use neither pen nor calculator to make the financial statement. Accountants nowadays use computers to do all the jobs. Why accountants use computer as their vital working tool? The reason is not hard to understand: computer makes accounting way simple than it used to be. For instance, Enterprise resource planning as known as ERP software replaced up to 200 individual software used in the past. As a result, ERP becomes one of the most important software for every accounting personnel. Meanwhile computer helps accountants acquire the newest information. For instance, when an accountant needs to make a financial budget about export, the accountant needs to a make predict about the expect return in order to help the customers make best decisions. He or she does need the newest exchange rate between two countries in order to make the budget more precisely. In the past, accountant can hardly get the newest exchange rate at this moment. But because of the technology development, the accountant can ‘google’ the latest exchange rate and make an accuracy financial budget. </p>
		<p>Because of the importance of technology, the education of accounting actually was influenced by the technology. The article ‘What is accounting’ from a famous scholarly journals called ‘The Accounting Review’. The author Raun, Donald L. firstly gave us a general idea about what is accounting and different perspective about accounting. In the beginning, he introduced that accounting should be divided into two main types: financial accounting and administrative accounting And he mentioned the future education about accounting. As he mentioned firstly because of the computer development, accounting students may not need high mathematics skills. It is not hard to understand, in the past, accountants need use their math knowledge to solve the tasks but now computer can help them solve the mathematics problems. So as the development of computer occur, future accounting major may not require high level of mathematics skills. In other words, computer helps the accountants do their jobs easier. Then author Raun, Donald L. stated that because of the effect of computer on accounting, “it is important for accounting students to learn this technology.” Raun, Donald L. "What is Accounting?" The Accounting Review 37.4 (1962): 769. ProQuest. Web. 6 Nov. 2013. Like the drivers need to know how to use cars, accountants really need to learn how to use the computer to help them do the jobs. Dr. Martin, an economy professor from Michigan State University said: “Computer is so important for accountants nowadays. We can say that accountants do all of their jobs in front of computer. Computer is one of the best gifts God gave accountants. As a result, computer science is in required course in accounting major.”  </p>
		<p>Actually technology has some influence among both research and communication as well. Because of the development of technology, the research of accounting is much more easier. It is easier for people to research sources and even post their researches to share. At the same time because of the development of technology, the communication of accounting is easier as well. Customers can contact accountants by skype, MSN message or e-mail. Customers can contact with the accountants without moving from place to place. All of those examples illustrate the convenience technology brought to accountants. </p>
		<p>The charts below illustrate the three important parts of accounting and how to prove them: </p>
		<p>From all of the descriptions above it is not hard to understand what statue technology has in accounting world. “ I can’t do my job without computer.” Li Xu, an accountant from China said. “My work in the office makes me face computer everyday. I cannot imagine my career without computer.” Because of the importance of technology, accountants and accounting students should pay more time to learn and use the technology to help their career. At the same time, the education of accounting should pay more effort on technology learning. </p>

        <p>It seems like literacy work is not related to accounting. In fact, literacy work influence and help the accounting a lot. There are a lot of financial magazines in this world. For example ‘Journal of Accountancy’, ‘Accounting Today’ and ‘Accounting and Business’. Those financial magazines help some publishers and accountants make money. It is not hard to understand that publishers make money from the magazines they sell, at the same time, some accountants who wrote articles for the magazines also gain some returns. There are a lot of accountants who like to do the research and conclude new theory. Their life will be improved due to those financial magazines. Because of this extra income, they can do more researches they are interested in. And all of those make a virtuous circle. On the other hand, other accountants and even normal people can be benefited from the financial magazines. Both accountants and normal people can gain new knowledge and learn how the economy’s doing. Accountants who gain more knowledge from the magazines may publish article one day. And all of those start a nice competition in accounting which leads to make accounting develop and perfect. Moreover, those financial magazines can lead to an economy growth. Meanwhile, the quality of life improved due to those financial magazines. </p>
		<p>In a conclusion, accounting is the “ the language of business”, it is the process of identifying, recording, and communicating events of an organization to interested users. Because accounting will lead to economic returns, it is one of the most important disciplines of the whole society. There are three important parts of accounting. Firstly, research helps accountants to learn the dynamic condition of current economy. One way to improve researching is improve the reading skill. In addition, communication is a needful part of accounting as well. The communication in accounting includes talking and writing. To improve talking and writing skill accountants need to “stand in customers’ shoes’. At last, technology is also important for accountants because its practicability and effectiveness. The way to improve technology skill is just put more time to learn and use it. </p>
