			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>	But what should we do to mitigate the surplus of musicians in order to help musicians? There are two ways to solve the surplus of musicians in the US. Firstly, the music market should be organized and improved for those musicians who want to find a music-related job. At the same time the public media should give play to the real role it should play: tell public the truth. The public media should sound the alarm to the population that only few people become famous singer, so the musician should within their means. </p>
			<p>If the music market is organized better, more talented musicians will find the appropriate job for them. Firstly the music company should have a big and open job fair for musicians every year. The music company can hire not only good singers but also music stuff. Musicians will compete their talent of music—not only singing but also creating music and lyrics. Not all of the people like to compete in a large stage and voted by people. A job fair is kind of like a more private competition for them to find their way to live with music. Even though a big job fair may cost a lot of money, the music company can record the procession of the job fair and share it at the official website. This will help improve the staff’s popularity and draw public’s attention to this music company. Secondly, the music company should give everyone a fair chance to enter the company. Nowadays, music is more and more like a family job. If your father is a composer, it will be much more easier for you to become a composer and work with big bug. But it is unfair for those who have no relatives in music industry. So the music company should use talent to decided whether use this person instead of nepotism.</p>
			<p>In addition, if the public media disseminate that only few people become famous singer, it will help musicians to keep calm. From The Voice and all music competitive shows we see so many success, sometime people will think it is not so hard to become succeed which is wrong. There are so many musicians in this world dream to become famous. Everyone has been taught in primary school: “Never give up your dream.” But an unrealistic dream will harm a good people. Not all of the people have the talent to become professional musicians. But what the public media do is insist “Come and your dream will come true.” There are all kinds of different people in the world like music, but not all of them are so good at this. Only a little part of the people stands at the top of the music industry and only a little part of the people can approach to their dream. Of course, the media should never say that: “Give up your dream” but remind the public that not all of the people will be successful in order to make them stay calm on this. We have saw so many people gave up everything to chase their dreams as a result lost everything even though their families. The social media should tell the public to try to approach the dream, but at the same time stay calm and consider whether they are good enough to become a professional musician. Sometimes it will be better if they treat music as a hobby. Because the way to chase this dream is so hard and so long, someone may spend his or her whole life to chase but gain nothing. The public media should state the fact for everyone but let the person himself or herself to decide whether it is worth or not. So the media should let them know the difficulties in order to assist him or her to make a good choice for his or her life.</p>
