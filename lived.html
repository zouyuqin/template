		<h1>My life with Excel software</h1>
		<p>Nowadays, technology has tremendous influence among people. Our life is more closely related to technology, for instance: computers, mobile phones and even cars. There is a joke about nowadays people: people in the past need foods and drinks to survive, but people now need technology to survive. From that we can see the status technology have in our hearts. But some people will ask: “how much power does technology have?” As for me, a freshman in college, technology even led me to choose my major and future career. </p>
		<p>The most important technology for me is computer. The first time I saw it I felt scared because it was a big “guy” and it looked really wired. Back to that time, I was a technology fool and hated technology. But once I started to use it to play games and watch movies, I started to like it. However the best part of computer is neither games nor movies, it is Excel software. When I was a junior in middle school, there was an assignment in computer class that required us to build an Excel table in order to make a budget. In the beginning I thought Excel did suck and I had no idea how can I build a table and count the number. I even count the number by my calculator! “That’s a stupid software.” I thought at that time. So I talked to my computer teacher Mr. Zhang about how stupid this software was. After I finish my complaint he started to teach me how Excel work..</p>
		<p>I learnt that Excel is a brilliant office processing software. Mr. Zhang even told me that for some officers Excel is much more important than Word software which means Excel software is used more often than Word software for a lot of people. I was really surprised because in my opinion at that time Word software was the most amazing invention in the world. “People like Excel because it is really convenient.” Mr. Zhang said, “ Excel is widely used in management, statistics, finance and many other areas of finance and economics. If you want to be a business woman you should love it.” I didn’t believe him. So that he told me that in fact there were a great amount of math formulas in the Excel software that can be choose to use. I still remember my surprised face back to that time. Then he started to show me how brilliant Excel was.</p>
		<p>Firstly he showed me how to insert an organization chart. When I was a middle school student, every time I saw organization charts in textbooks I thought they use Paint software to draw those convenient charts. And that was the first time I started to admire this software. After that he taught me how to hide the grid lines from my sheets. Before he taught me this I was always confused but after that it was clear that Excel software is really convenient. In addition he taught me how to add rounded border, remove conditional format, make items unique and so on. But the cutest part is the changing shape color for cell comments. Back to that time, I was a little girl who loved all kind of lovely things. Mr. Zhang taught me to select the cell comment and then clicked “draw menu” to choose “change auto shape” option. There were a lot of cute shapes there. My favorite shape was a heart symbol. For a middle school student this is cute and awesome enough to make it prettier. As a result I fell in love with this smart software. Even though I will never change the shape to a heart symbol I still love this software so much. Especially after time passed I really understood how it works and how convenient it is. There is so much cool software in the world but the Excel software is the only one I knew works for human and designs for our normal people even a technology fool like me.</p>
		<p>Even my mom could tell my progress. Before I knew Excel software I was that kind of girl who prefered television than computer. But after I knew how amazing Excel software was, I started to play with it and even play with computer. After a few months I did really good job in my computer class. Moreover, I was awarded as an honor student in my computer class. The technology fool started to change. When I was a senior in high school I had yearbook class and did a good job. When my friends asked me how come I did so well in computer. I told them: “It is because I love playing with Excel software.” “Then you should major in computer in college.” Said my friend. That was the first time I started to think about my major in my college. I totally knew that a major could even change a person’s life. Because of that I hesitated about whether I should major in computer. “You like computer but not that much.” said my mother, “What you like the most is Excel software. What about choose a major related to Excel software?” At that moment a sudden enlightenment burst in my heart. I really knew work with Excel software instead of computer was what I want the most. As a result I put my aim on business major. But I still struggled between finance and accounting major. Because of my confusion I asked my sister who worked in college. She told me: “Those two are both really good major. There are a lot of common between finance and accounting. But there are still some differences between finance and accounting. For instance, finance is like a large lake which accounting is a brook. Finance needs a grand view but accounting needs a specific and meticulous skill.” I did not feel really confident about grand viewing the economy besides I thought it would be great for me to learn a specific skill in college life, at the end I choose accounting as my major. Even though I heard a lot of rumors about how hard it is going to be I still believed in my choice because I believed in my love with Excel software. I fully hoped that what I love will lead me to become succeed.</p>
		<p>Excel software is a brilliant software which helps me to improve my computer skills and change my view of computer. But the most amazing part of Excel software is that it helps me to make a good decision—major in accounting—I strongly believe in my choice. Thanks to Excel software, otherwise I cannot imagine my life now. Excel totally changed my life. In a word, technology is almost the most important part in our life. We cannot underestimate its power. Technology is around us everywhere; it changes different people’s life—maybe better or even worth—we cannot deny the power and the influence of technology nowadays. From my example we can see technology can even lead me to choose my major. What I strongly believe is that different people has different story with technology—this is twenty-one-century people. I am proud that I am a member of them.</p>
