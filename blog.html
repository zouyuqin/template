		<h1>In class activity 1</h1>
		<p>We watched a video today. And the purpose of the video is to describe a gay’s experience. The author uses the passion to tell the story and make everyone get touched. The author firstly read a poem to start the story, and this poem is really related to the story. And then he read a letter to his uncle to show the story. He said that: “Yes, I am a gay.” And cry. After that, he shows that it gets better. At this moment everybody who watched the video get touched. This project is really helpful to my Lived Experience because it helped me to understand how to make people get touched and how to show my emotion. Fake emotion will not make people feel my passion, so when I am writing I should focus on my own emotion, and write what my heart wants me to write. And then the reader will feel my deepest emotion. </p>

		<h1>In class activity 2</h1>
		<p>We spent two classes watching an awesome movie named The Social Network. Actually I think this film is a great one, it shows us how Facebook was founded and how hard it was. I really disagree the main character’s idea. He said that women were poultry. Even though the role of women in this movie is kind of weak, I still believe that women can do some job in real life, and even better then men. And in writing and communication part, technology really changed the way we writing and communication. For instance, nowadays we use word software to type our essay, we use Facebook to write our blog article, and we use Facebook to post our emotion and communicate with each other. Technology totally changed us. At last, I think formal education is really important for a successful man. In my EC202 course, my professor asked us: “What investment can get the biggest return?” Some of people guessed stocks, and some guessed mutual funds. But the answer is education. As a result, formal education can bring tremendous economic return, and then all of those wealth combine together and become personal success. </p>
		
		<h1>In class activity 3</h1>
		<p>Today, we saw an advertisement in class. I really like this advertisement, it shows us something we never thought of. Firstly, the main character Eminem drives and we can see Detroit. The imaginary of Detroit is serious and full of potential. The inclusion of Eminem’s “Lose Yourself” shows that nowadays people always lose themselves and don’t know how strong they are, how important they are. And I really like the tagline which said “ Imported from Detroit”. Firstly, there are a lot of people think imported goods are better. So this advertisement use “import” instead of “made”. And “ Imported from Detroit” shows they are really proud of making this car in Detroit. At last, the voiceover is the best part. It gives us confidence, make us fell confidence about their production and make us fell confidence about Detroit. In a conclusion, this advertisement is awesome. </p>

		<h1>9-4-2013</h1>
		<p>Today I took my first WRA 110 class. It was really interesting because when I arrived the classroom I found out that the classroom we use has a lot of computers. “It looks like a computer class.” I thought. Then I went into the classroom. Everybody seems so nice. I didn’t have any friend in this course, so that I choose to sit in the front seat.
	“Why don’t you turn on the light?” This was the first sentence Dr. Daniel said. At the beginning I thought that she was a student in our course, but later I found out she stand in the front of the classroom. “Oh my God, she is our teacher.” I thought.
	Then Dr. Daniel started to introduce the course. She used a lot of words that I was not really familiar with. So I was really confuse. So I asked the Chinese girl next to me, and she told me she had no idea either. To be honest, I was really upset at that moment. But after later, I finally found out we were required to use a website http://cdaniels75.github.io/wra110/index.html. It is a website created by Dr. Daniel. We can find our syllabus, course policies, schedules, assignment sheets, resources, activities and some additional links here. This website reminded me of the theme of this course----science and technology. I realized that we would not only write things about technology but also use technology to write. Everything seemed so interesting for me.
	Later, after I went back to dorm I found out that we were required to finish 6 projects in this semester. “It’s not too bad.” My roommate talked to me, “Maybe I should attend this course next semester.”
	But, to be honest, I am really not confident about my writing skills. Even though I attended regular English course in high school in California, English is still my second language. I am good at writing in Chinese, but not so good at English. Am I able to finish those 6 projects? Will I get an A in this course? I was really stressed.
	Actually, I didn’t hate writing in English. Back to my high school year, I wrote an ending for ‘Snow Flower and Secret Fan’, a famous novel, as a project. And I got a really high score in that project. And my English teacher Mrs. Nelson said: “Wow, I can’t imagine this is from an international student.” As a result, I liked writing in English. But still lack of confidence of writing in English.
	I really hope that I can do well in this course. And make some progress in this course. I heard in the past that college year contains a lot of essays. I was freaking out of this. So I really want to do better in writing in order to write better essays in my college year.

		<h1>9-11-2013</h1>
		<p>This is my third week in Michigan State University. I finally recognize different ways to go to my courses. 
	Today, in WRA class, Dr. Daniel helped us with our technical setup. Today’s class was so confusing. I had no idea why we should use those wired technology. For instance, Eli and Github. In other courses, we are only required to use D2L or Angel to turn in our homework or get power point for the course. But in WRA class we were required to use not only D2L but also Eli and Github.
	Firstly, we signed up for Eli review. I never heard about this website. The only thing I noticed about this website was this website was really ugly. To be honest, I didn’t like this website. Later, Dr. Daniel taught us how to sign up for Github. Compared to Eli, Github seemed so cute. The logo of Github is a cat. And our automatic portrait was different but cute. I liked this website. But later I found out I was totally stupid. Eli was much more kind to us compare to Github.
	The function of Eli is just turn in our rough project and review other’s project. But the function of Github is to create our own website. It was so hard for me. I had no idea how to use it, and how to create a blog. I gave up pretty soon.
	And one of the worst news I heard today was, there was a draft due today. Because of my careless, I did not even know that we are required to turn in our draft today. When I saw a lot of people turn in their paper I just felt like I screwed this course. But later, Dr. Daniel told us we could also email to her. That was one of the best news I have ever heard. 
	But when I went back to my dorm I was upset again. Because I had no idea how can I start my draft of my first assignment. To be honest, I never wrote a draft before. So I did not even know what was a draft, and how should I wrote a draft. As a result, I searched at the internet about how to write a draft. After I figured out how to write a draft, I started to think about what theme should I choose. This assignment is a Lived Experience project. It required us to identify an academic and professional career and one piece of technology that has led us to our chosen field. In the past I only wrote some book reports. So it was really hard to pick my theme of this assignment. I used 30 minutes to think about what should I write and 20 minutes to write my draft. I found out that I was that kind of person who used a lot of time to think about what should I write. Finally, I turned my draft in. It was a really stressed day.
 </p>
		
		<h1>9-18-2013</h1>
		<p>This week is a really busy week. I have two projects to be due, one is Personal Finance, and another is Lived Experiences project.
	I finished my Personal Finance project on Monday, and plan to finish my WRA assignment on Tuesday. I know I should have started to do those two assignments on Saturday or Sunday. But I was too lazy to do so. As a result, I went to bed at 2:00 on Monday, and went to bed at 2:30 on Tuesday. What a crazy week!
	Even though I did finish the draft last week, I still spent a lot of time to consider my theme of this project. It is really hard for me to decide what I want to write. We are required to write a report to describe a technology has impacted our choice of major or career. I think this project is unfair to me. Because I am a freshman in MSU,I don’t even know what my major is about. And there was never a technology make me make this decision. The reason why I want to study in accounting is because I think accountant are required everywhere so that I don’t need to worry about my job in the future. As for technology, I am really not good at technology. For instance, I never played a computer game because I am really bad at playing game. Some people feel I am wired but I really don’t like computer games.
	So I decided to choose a technology which seems like related to my major---Excel software. I do like this software and I saw a lot of accountant use this software. So I think it will be good to chose this theme to write.
	As a result I wrote a story about Excel software and me. I used to be a technology fool, but after I started to know Excel software, I started to like it. And I wrote a story about my computer teacher and me. Thanks to him, I started to like this software and as a result I chose accounting as my major. Actually I lied in the project, but after this project, I feel like I like Excel software better and want to learn more about this magic software.

		<h1>9-25-2013</h1>
		<p>This week Dr. C. Daniel introduced to us about the cultural analysis project. I was shocked about this project. Because this project requires us write 1800-2000 words. In fact I never wrote those many words in English. Because English is my second language.
	It is really hard for me to imagine me writing an 1800 words paper. And I almost gave up. Because I hated writing essay. Compared to the Lived Experience Project, this project required better organized language and scientific attitude. The Lived Experience Project is like a story but Cultural Analysis Proposal is like a real essay which required us a neutral attitude. I was almost crazy when I heard about this project.
	Cultural Analysis Proposal asks us to investigate a specific social issue and its import on society. In addition, we are asked to analysis cultural artifact. That is really hard for me. Because I am an international student, I do know some social issue in China but not in America. I was totally upset about this project. And I even talked to my roommate about dropping this course. But she encouraged me. “What is your favorite TV show in America?” she asked. I considered for a while, and answered: “ I like the drama in ABC family. But all of the dramas are so fake. I can’t write those.” She thought for a moment and asked me: “What about some shows like American Idol or some reality show?” “Oh yeah, I like The Voice. I really like the season two.” I answered.
	So thanks to her, I finally picked my theme of this project. The reason why I picked this theme is because everybody knows this show and likes it. Actually in China, we have The Voice in China too. In addition, The Voice do show us some serious social issue about musicians. I really think this topic is new and really interesting. So that I picked The Voice as my theme of Cultural Analysis Proposal.
	In a word, today is a really stressed day, and I really want to thank my roommate. Without her help I cannot even finish my draft about Cultural Analysis Proposal.
 </p>
		
		<h1>10-9-2013</h1>
		<p>Today, I want to describe why I choose The Voice as the theme of my cultural analysis proposal. We have The Voice in China too, it was one of the most popular TV show at that period. Even though some people said that this TV show was too fake, I still liked. So when I first came to America, I studied in Western Christian High School in California. Because during the high school year I didn’t have anything to do so that I started to watch The Voice online. Firstly, I really like the process of the competition. Yes, I really like the special chair and the ‘blind’ listening part. It was cool. I choose The Voice as my theme of the project is not only because it is interesting but only because I saw different kind of musicians. Before I saw this TV show I thought that musicians were kind of the same. But after I saw them I found out that they were diversified. Every single one has different story. So, as a result, I pick this TV show as my topic of the project. </p>
		
		<h1>10-16-2013  </h1>
		<p>OK，it is the time to finish my cultural analysis project. It is soooooo hard for me. I just typed 1000 word and became extremely exhausted, but I still need to write another 800 words. In the beginning I was really confident about my project, I thought that this project well be really interesting and easy to right. But now I figured out that I was wrong, totally wrong. Firstly, it is so hard to describe why this is a social, in addition it is way harder to describe and explain how to solve this problem. Now I am sitting in front of the desk and want to kill myself. Everything seems so hard for me. I don’t know if I can successful finished it. It reminds me of my high school year in China. In Chinese test, we were required to write a 1200-word-essay. 1200 words were too little for me, I always wanted to write more, but I could not. In the opposite, I almost spent all of my energy to write the paper but the words are still not enough. How ironic it is! OK, I am going back to write my paper, good luck to my self. </p>
		
		<h1>10-30-2013g</h1>
		<p>It is the worst news that I have ever heard: our newest project. I never saw a paper is as difficult as this one. It requires 2700-3000 words. I wanted to give up when I saw the requirement. But at this moment, my mom skyped with me and asked me how’s going. “Not so good.” I answered. “Why is it?” She asked. So that I told her that I have a difficult essay, and it requires 2700-3000 words. “That’s not so bad.” She said, “Try it.” “I really want to give up.” I said. She looked at me, and her face was really serious. “Never say that please.” She kept saying, “Sometimes it seems really hard to achieve one thing, but after you trying and trying and trying, you will be there. I trust you.” “I do not trust myself.” I said. My mom looked at me and said slowly, “Trust yourself, you can do it.” I still remember her face at that moment, and all of those words make me start to try started to do the project. Thanks to my mom. </p>
		
		<h1>11－6－2013</h1>
		<p>Yesterday, I spent all night doing my formal research report. This is the longest report I have ever written.  </p>
		<p>I started to write the report at six. It was really hard at the first beginning. Because I finished the rough draft a week ago I actually forgot what I wanted to write. Yesterday was such an unlucky day. I just finished a super difficult biology test and did a bad job, after that I needed to write a 2700-300 words report. I was almost dead yesterday. </p>
		<p>So, I spent a bunch of time trying to calm down. But it was too hard for me. I even wanted to throw my computer away. It seems like everything was wrong. Finally, after 30 minutes I started to write something. </p>
		<p>Firstly, I read my rough draft. Even though it was funny when you were trying to read something you wrote and trying to understand what did you want. In fact, when I was reading my rough draft I was totally messed up due to my abstract words. To be honest, as a writer of the rough draft, I didn’t really get the point. But after looking through the whole rough draft, I finally understand what I wanted to say a week ago. </p>
		<p>Secondly, I wrote a new introductory of my report. In the rough draft of this report, I used the introductory to start the paper. But I changed my mind. I actually wrote an introductory to state that not all of the people understand what are their majors about. It helped my reader to understand the purpose of my paper--- due to some vague idea about what their major was about. The purpose of my paper was trying to let new accounting students to understand what was accounting about. </p>
		<p>Thirdly, I tried to understand what was accounting. In fact I am a freshman and have no idea about what is accounting about. So I interviewed my aunt who was an accountant in China. In the past I thought accounting was just account things. It was stupid, wasn’t it? But after studying accounting, I understand accounting is not just related to count numbers but manage financial sources. </p>
		<p>In a word, this experience is really helpful for my writing skill. Even though in the first beginning I hated this project so much, it is a remarkable experience in my college life. </p>
