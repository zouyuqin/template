			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>One significant social issue is that a lot of musicians cannot find a music-related job. In this TV show we can see that there are a lot of people in this world insist their music dreams. They may come from different countries, have different culture, study music major or learn music by themselves, but they have a same dream—it is music. From The Voice we saw so many talent people who are really good at singing and love singing. But dream is kind of fragile in front of the reality.</p>
			<p>A great amount of talented musicians cannot even afford the standard of living. It really cost a lot to chase their dreams. Even though music is gorgeous, it is really expensive to make music. For most of people it is really hard to keep on doing music if they don’t have a good-paid job. But some people will ask: “Why don’t do some job related to music.” The market for music-related labor is too small for this huge number of music zealots. It is not hard to understand, because the number of successful people is always small and it is even smaller in music area. One good example to illustrate this phenomenon is from Ke$ha, one of the most popular pop star in the US. She mentioned that she used to be a girl who really wanted to succeed. Ke$ha did some crazy things in order to let Prince make album for her. She said: “I did actually crawl under a fence to get into Prince’s house. I paid the gardener five bucks to help me make it to the other side.” Wenn. Contactmusic. Contactmusic.com Ltd. Web.11 December 2009. Consequently, she was kicked out from Prince’s house. From this example we can see that even have a chance to be successful seems to be too hard for those people and that is why there are so many talented people claim bankruptcy. It is all because dream is so heavy for those musicians.</p>
			<p>The Voice really contribute a lot to the social issue that it is really hard for musicians to find a job. The Voice and all this kind of reality television singing competition give those people a stage to show their talent and work with famous people. Obviously, they never need to intrude into someone’s house to show their talent. Firstly The Voice and all this kind of reality television singing competition gives them a chance to prove their ability, and introduce them to some famous singer like Adam Levine. Moreover, The Voice helps those musicians to be known and even have their fans. Like writers need readers, musicians need audiences as well. Even though The Voice cannot help all of the talented musicians to make their dreams come true, it contributes a lot. </p>
