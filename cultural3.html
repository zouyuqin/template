			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>The Voice was based on The Voice of Holland. The first season of The Voice was aired on April twenty-sixth. Once it came out, The Voice wined a tremendous attention from the public and gave NBC an unprecedented profit. Now not only the US has The Voice, there are also The Voice in China, The Voice in England and so on. The reason why The Voice became so popular is because it came out with a really different way to compete. There are four coaches in The Voice who are all super stars. The reason why The Voice hires four coaches is to let the coaches to choose their team members and guide the members through the game. Firstly coaches choose if they want this person and if there are more than one coaches want this person, then he or she will have a chance to chose which coach he or she wants to work with. Through the competition, coaches will choose the best members in their teams to fight for the teams. The show’s innovative format features four stages of competition: the blind auditions, the battle rounds, the knockouts, and finally, the live performance shows. The Voice Official Site. NBCUniversal Media,LCC.web. One of the most interesting parts of the show is the preliminary round. In the preliminary round coaches choose if they want the singer with the “blind audition” --- if they push the “I want you” button the special chairs will help them to turn around so that they can see what the singer looks like--which is really different from other shows. Obviously the most impressive part of The Voice is this fresh “blind audition” part. Even though there are a lot of queries about whether the “blind audition” is useful for coaches to find the best voice or not, people still like the Voice and this special round even became a representation for The Voice. For instance when people talk about The Voice, the first response for most of the people is: “Oh, is it the ‘blind audition’ one?” From this we can see how this creative round made tremendous influence among people.</p>
