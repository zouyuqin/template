		<h1>Final Project: Cultural Analysis</h1>
		<p>The second project we were assigned in this class was the Cultural Analysis project. This project was different than the Lived Experiences paper in length, structure, tone, and audience. This paper was 1800-2100 words and designed to be written much more formally as an investigative report. For this report, we were directed to choose some type of media/popular culture, relate it to a social issue, and propose a solution. The paper itself was to be divided into 6 sections: an executive summary, a background analysis, a description of the issue, a proposed solution, anticipated results/effects, and a conclusion. Many students were not used to writing with this type of structure in place, but as you can see, this structure helped facilitate the flow of ideas for some students. The following are a few testimonies of what this project takes and a few suggestions to keep in mind while writing this essay.</p>
		<p>“The theme of this proposal was The Voice and musicians. In the beginning I was really upset of this project. Because the feedback I received was terrible. There was one student gave me the lowest grade I have ever got. She said my rough draft was confusing and didn’t make sense. Then I started to think about how to write a rough draft. In the past I never wrote a rough draft and I thought it was useless. But when I started to write the real people, I realized the function of rough draft. Rough draft helps me to understand the main purpose of my paper and learn how to allot each paragraph. Actually I didn’t really like this paper. Because I think sometimes I could not introduce my viewpoint well in English. In fact, I don’t know if others can understand my article. And what I really like this project is the viewpoint. I tried a new aspect to think about those music competitions.” -Yuiqng Zou</p>
		<p>“When writing the cultural analysis project it really challenges you to pick an issue important to you and write about it.  You have to use creativity skills as well as organization skills to produce a meaningful essay that an audience can relate to.  It asks you to pick a topic, such as a music video, which is what I did, and talk about how it is controversial to a specific issue.  For example, Robin Thickes’ Blurred Lines music video objectified women and showed them walking around nude for men’s enjoyment.  So you would have to take that and expand on the topic, talk about why it is important to you and what methods could change it.  Then it is recommended that you research and get some facts and or statistics that support your opinion.  This is a really fun essay to write if you get into it and take it seriously.  I got absorbed into it and ended up writing a very good paper because of proper research, proper documentation of the visual and expressing my opinion in writing.” -Dylan Graham

		<p>“For the Cultural Analysis Proposal, we have to analyze an artifact of popular culture and discuss a social issue it brings out. This proposal was hard for me because it required 1,800 words or more, and I never wrote an essay long like this. I figured that as I follow the instruction, I successfully wrote a 1,800 words essay. Thus, the key to finish this long essay is to follow the instruction. More specifically, you should divide your essay into six sections including executive summary, Background analysis (analysis of the artifact), Description of the issue, Proposed solution, Anticipated results/effects, and Conclusion. Once you divide your essay into six sections as the instruction indicated, you will know that you only need to write six short essays, 300 words for each. This will definitely make it feel lots easier. Since this essay required a works cited/references page, I suggest new student to search “APA Citation” in Google, you will find a format of APA Citation and you will learn how to write a citation as the APA instruction shown. In the future of our academic career, we are 100% required to analyze a work, maybe an artifact, a paper, or a book. It would be so much easier for our future if we stated to practice write an analysis from now on. In addition, the instruction of this project shows us a fabulous form of writing an analysis. Put some effort on this project, you will learn a useful writing skill for sure.” - Rong Huang</p>
		<p>“My topic is about Cyber game which is not very familiar with most of audiences, so i add much professional knowledge that I know into essay, giving the background information and helping audiences to start think in my way. This is really helpful in introducing a strange thing to the public. Generally, the cultural analysis project give lots of idea about writing a good essay, including the strategy of writing essay and language application in the transition section of an essay. In order to build a bridge between artifact and social issue and help audience to clearly realize my points, I use plenty of logical transitional words connect each part of my essay. I also built a blueprint for my essay before I start writing. It really benefited me to understand what I am doing and what I should improve during my writing.”  -Ziqi Nie</p>
		<p> As you can see, everyone had differing opinions and viewpoints on this assignment because of their experiences. Also, everyone learned different things from this project. From how to write a rough draft, organizing ideas, formulating opinions, and analyzing problems and solutions, this project tested our writing abilities on many levels. When writing this essay, it was especially important to plan your flow of ideas in order to accomplish the objectives laid out for this assignment. By being able to choose any piece of media or pop culture, this project allowed each individual to express himself while learning how to write in the form of a proposal. All in all, the advice this group wants to lend to students taking this class in the future is to pick a topic you like, try your hardest on it, and use this project to become a better writer.</p>
